           <p>              
              I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work. The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will instruct his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease. There is no substitute for hard work. There's a way to do it better - find it.

           <h3>Alert Einstein</h3>
           <p>
          	Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value. In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity. A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new. Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile. Life is like riding a bicycle, to keep your balance you must keep moving. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character. Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. It’s not that I am so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer. Insanity is doing the same thing, over and over again, but expecting different results.

           <h3>Steve Jobs</h3>
           <p>
						Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful… that’s what matters to me. Creativity is just connecting things. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary. You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on it.

            <h6>Inventor, businessman</h6>
            <p>
              Thomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor. He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed "The Wizard of Menlo Park", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.

            <h6>Physics, philosophy</h6>
            <p>
              Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

              Stephen William Hawking was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author, who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death. He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009. Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the British Sunday Times best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks.
